# ADM-HOMEWORK1-GENNARO-DE-CICCO-2128464-
This repository contains my solutions for the HomeWork1, Msc Data Science, course of "Algorithmic Methods of Data Mining and Laboratory", year 2023/2024. 
I have solved Python coding challenges on HackerRank. '\n'
There is a PDF file that contains every submit and a file.py divided in Problem1 and Problem2.
Each chapter of the Problem1 is divided in challenges and for each of them I propose my solution.
On the other hand, the Problem2 consists in 7 more-elaborate Python challenges.
